# Methane-Update
Files relevant to the methane Marvel update project 

Transition File: 
Col1: line position in several units (Hz, cm-1 etc) as given by each source
Col2 and Col3: line position uncertainty in same units
Col4 - Col7: upper state quantum numbers (polyad, J, C, counting number a)
Col8 - Col11: lower state quantum numbers (polyad, J, C, counting number a)
Col12: unique tag name indicating the source

Segment File:
Map between the sources and the units used for the line position

Energy Levels file:
The energies derived from the MARVEL4 run.
Col1 - Col4: polyad, J, C, counting number a
Col5: energy in cm-1
Col6: energy uncertainty in cm-1
Col7: number of Combination Differences (the number of transitions that define the state)
